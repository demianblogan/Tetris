# Tessera — Development Backlog

Source of truth for completed work, the version in progress, and planned
versions. Update it whenever an item changes scope or release.

Followed the *Until Last Asteroid* (ULA) process in two phases:

1. **Phase 1 — code maturity (`v1.0.x`).** No new gameplay. Turned the
   prototype-grade code into a professional, bug-free, de-duplicated, well
   layered codebase, porting proven systems from ULA. **Complete.**
2. **Phase 2 — features (`v1.1.0`+).** New systems and content on the
   cleaned-up foundation. Re-scoped on 2026-09-09 to a short wind-down — see
   **Planned**.

Each version: its own `v1.x.0-<slug>` branch (no prefix), a PR titled
`v<version> — <Name>`, a `v<version>` tag, and a GitHub Release. Commit style
follows ULA: imperative subject + a "why" body.

Cross-cutting decisions:

- **Name:** Tessera (Latin for a mosaic tile).
- **UI:** a reusable, cross-project UI library built on the retained
  widget-tree + `Measure`/`Arrange` layout pass, completed with an input/focus
  layer and ULA's reusable rendering helpers. Intended to be shared back into
  ULA and project 3.
- **No ECS** — one dynamic piece + a 10×20 grid does not need it.
- **Data-driven, selectively** — authored content (piece defs, SRS kicks,
  scoring table, gravity curve, escalation tiers, localization) as JSON under
  `assets/data/`. Runtime/user data goes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, never the repo.
  Core loop stays code.
- **Dead-code removal** — periodic project-wide passes, not piecemeal; the last
  one is part of v1.7.0. Ports are done whole, not pre-trimmed.

## Released

### v1.0

- Original portfolio version: playable Tetris with 7-bag pieces, ghost piece,
  progressive difficulty, next-piece preview, screen shake, row-clear and
  landing effects, a custom UI framework, a settings menu, top-5 high scores,
  and shader-based CRT / blur / glow post-processing.

### v1.3.0 — In-game menu & mode select

A new Pause screen built to the menu-shell standard, and a mode-select screen
behind "Start Game". No gameplay-rules changes; Game Over untouched (its rework
is v1.5.0).

- **`states/ScreenHost`** — the screen swap + `ui/MenuHeader` + forward / back
  transition + DualSense-lightbar handoff, extracted from `MenuShell` (now a
  thin subclass supplying the animated menu background and the `MainMenuScreen`
  home). Sub-screens take a `ScreenHost&`; the ring's backdrop shove goes
  through `ScreenHost::OnNavigate`. A `HomeDrivesHeader()` / `OnHomeRebuilt()`
  hook lets a host keep a persistent header on its home screen.
- **Pause** (`states/PauseState : ScreenHost`, `states/PauseMenuScreen`) — on
  pause, `GameplayState` snapshots the frame into a `RenderTexture`;
  `assets/shaders/mosaic.frag` "solidifies" it (blur + large-pixel quantise +
  darken) with a front that sweeps top-down on entry and bottom-up on Resume.
  A "PAUSE" header (amber, the mode-select "Campaign" hue) rises from the top
  edge as a left `ui/MenuButtonColumn` slides in low in the frame: Resume /
  Restart / Options / Back to Main Menu, each in its own colour. Resume
  reverses the whole animation before popping. Restart and Back to Main Menu
  raise a `ui/ConfirmDialog`. Options opens over the frozen frame through the
  shared `ScreenHost` transition; settings apply live.
- **Mode select** (`states/ModeSelectScreen`) — "Start Game" now morphs into a
  two-level column like Options → Controls: **Campaign** (Start New Campaign /
  Continue Campaign / Select Level) and **Other Modes** (Marathon / Sprint /
  Ultra / Zen / Player vs Player). Only Marathon is live; the rest are disabled
  stubs. *(The stubs and the concept doc `docs/CAMPAIGN_AND_MODES.md` were
  removed in v1.4.0 when the campaign / modes roadmap was dropped — see Planned.)*
- **Gameplay music removed** — the old track did not fit; `MusicID::Gameplay`
  and its asset are gone. Gameplay stays music-free (a dynamic score is not
  planned under the wound-down roadmap).
- **Cleanup** — `Lerp` / `SmoothStep` / `EaseOut*` deduplicated into
  `ui/Easing.h` (were copy-pasted in ~10 TUs); three unused fonts
  (`BarNewRomanPix*`, `EpilepsySans`) deleted; dead `ScreenHost::ShowScreen` /
  `IsTransitioning` removed.

### v1.2.0 — Menu shell & Options

Originally scoped as "Modern rules"; **re-scoped** to the menu shell and a
complete Options screen. No gameplay-rules changes.

- **Menu shell** (`states/MenuShell` hosting `states/MenuScreen`s;
  `MainMenuScreen` / `CreditsScreen` / `OptionsScreen`). Activating a ring
  entry: the title flies up, the entries disintegrate to pixels, and the chosen
  entry morphs into the sub-screen header (`ui/MenuHeader` `RiseFrom` /
  `SinkTo`); reversed on Back. The shell owns the shared ambient
  (aurora / backdrop / sparks / version / lightbar). Back-out returns focus to
  the entry you left from.
- **Credits screen** — a 9-slice framed panel (`ui/NineSliceFrame`,
  `assets/textures/ui/frame.png`): developer blurb, email, YouTube, source
  link; a main-menu-style "Back to Main Menu" text button. Gold accent.
- **Options screen** (`states/OptionsScreen`) — a left category column
  (`ui/MenuButtonColumn`) with a right-hand panel that previews on hover and
  opens in place, the column compacting around the open entry.
  - **Gameplay** (teal) — Gamepad Vibration / Gamepad Lightbar / Screen Shake
    toggles.
  - **Graphics** (sky blue) — Screen Resolution + Window Mode carousels,
    Vertical Sync / Show FPS / CRT Filter toggles; a `display/DisplayManager`
    with deferred window recreation and letterboxing; Borderless locks the
    resolution. FPS-limit and block-style settings cut from the game.
  - **Audio** (green) — Sound / Music volume sliders (10 % steps).
  - **Controls** (violet) — its own slide-in sub-page: **Keyboard** (rebind the
    six gameplay keys; blink-to-capture, Escape / gamepad-B cancels, reserved
    and clashing keys rejected with a flash; layout-independent key names via
    `input/KeyName`) and **Gamepad** (read-only Xbox / PlayStation reference
    table from button-prompt atlases).
  - **Language** (rose) — slide-in sub-list, English live, the other four greyed
    (UI scaffold; localisation itself deferred).
  - Every panel: an Apply / Reset / Back row with dirty / at-defaults tracking
    and an unsaved-changes dialog (`states/SettingsCategoryPanel` base,
    `ui/ConfirmDialog`, `ui/OptionRow` + carousel / slider / toggle / key-bind
    rows).
- **Settings persistence** — `GameSettings` format 5: display, the graphics
  toggles, volumes, the six rebindable scancodes, the three gameplay toggles.
- **`haptics.json` lightbar map** — any `[r,g,b]` key; menus resolve their
  focused item through `HapticSettings::LightbarFor` so the DualSense resting
  colour is hand-calibratable. Menu navigation no longer flashes it; each
  TESSERA title letter snaps it to its own colour on landing.
- Gamepad rotation moved from the analog triggers to the shoulder buttons;
  gamepad detection re-scans each frame while none is connected.
- Quit-out-of-game removed from the main menu (only the "Quit" ring entry).

### v1.1.0 — Presentation

The first feature version: a proper opening sequence, a rebuilt main menu, the
gamepad-haptics port, and a data-driven audio mix. No gameplay-rules changes.

- **Loading screen** (`states/LoadingState`, `loading/AssetLoadJob` +
  `LoadingProgress`) — a tetromino-block progress bar; textures and shaders
  load synchronously (GPU work on a background thread deadlocks some drivers),
  a `std::jthread` streams the audio and fonts. Hands off to:
- **Company splash** (`states/CompanySplashState`) — fade in / hold / fade out
  over the logo; any input skips.
- One **shell music track** plays unbroken across loading → splash → menu.
- **Main menu, rebuilt** (`states/MainMenuState`, no longer `MenuScreenState`):
  - `ui/DropInTitle` — the "TESSERA" letters fall in one by one, squash and
    spring, then breathe; per-letter tetromino colour, dark outline, gradient
    fill, neon bloom, impact flash / shockwave / chromatic split, a landing
    sound with rising pitch and a growing gamepad pulse.
  - `ui/CarouselMenu` — entries on a shallow 3-D ring: front large and lit,
    sides dim and soft, back tucked behind the title. Left / right rotates it
    (keyboard, gamepad, or on-screen arrows with press feedback); it flies in
    like cars merging onto a roundabout, each with a swoosh and a rumble. Front
    entry glows in its colour; arrival flash on lock. Achievements and Credits
    are in as disabled placeholders.
  - Ambient background: `ui/MenuBackdrop` (drifting tetrominoes, shoved by
    navigation), `ui/MenuSparks` (rising embers), `ui/MenuAurora`
    (`menu_aurora.frag`).
  - The DualSense lightbar tracks the selected entry's colour.
- **`ui/GlowingCursor`** — the game draws its own cursor (pulsing glow, no halo,
  no trail), part of the scene so it gets the CRT pass; the OS cursor is hidden
  and ours shows only while the mouse is the active device.
- **`ui/FpsCounter`** + a "Show FPS" toggle in Graphics; grey version text
  bottom-right (`core/GameVersion.h`).
- **Gamepad haptics** (`input/gamepad/GamepadHaptics` + `HapticProfiles`,
  ported from ULA; `libs/DualSenseWindows/` vendored as source): rumble on
  land / hard-drop / wall / row-clear / tetris / level-up / game-over; a
  by-state lightbar; pitch-varied navigation ticks. Adaptive-trigger code is
  carried but dormant.
- **`audio/AudioBalance`** — per-sound / per-track volume coefficients from
  `assets/data/audio_balance.json` (`libs/nlohmann/json.hpp` vendored), tunable
  without a rebuild. `AudioPlayer` reworked to heap-own its voices and reclaim
  them by wall-clock (SFML 3's status poll cut short sounds).
- **CRT shader** keeps its scanlines / aberration / flicker / vignette, loses
  the screen curvature and edge cropping.
- `assets/music/` + `assets/sounds/` merged under `assets/audio/`.

### v1.0.9 — Polish pass

The end-of-Phase-1 cleanup, widened after a full read-through (a review put the
code at "solid Middle, near Middle-Senior"). No behaviour changes.

- **`MenuScreenState`** — MainMenu / Pause / GameOver shared a copy each of the
  button factory, `MenuInput` dispatch, mouse forwarding, layout refresh and the
  MenuList callback wiring. That's the base now; a subclass builds its layout,
  calls `AddMenuItem(text, callback)`, and overrides `OnBack()` /
  `HandleExtraEvent()`. The per-screen action enum and `PerformAction` switch
  are gone.
- **Pause backdrop** — `Application::Render` hard-coded `StateId::Pause` to blur
  the layer below, while the generic path (`IsTransparent()` +
  `StateMachine::RenderStates`' transparent-walk) ran only where nothing is ever
  transparent. Replaced with `State::GetBackdrop()`; the whole `StateId` enum
  and `GetId()` (its only consumer) are removed, along with the dead walk.
- **`SettingsRowList`** — the Settings screen's tagged-union selection model
  (`SelectableElement`, `selectedIndex`, the three-way highlight chain, a method
  per direction) is one focused class now: rows, current index, highlight,
  hit-testing, click-drag, and `onButton/Slider/Selection` callbacks.
- **`Layout::Arrange` / `Measure`** — the vertical and horizontal branches were
  mirror images and the size-rule switch was written three times; an `Axes`
  helper collapses each to one path. Fixes the latent cross-axis Fill case and
  the missing `Alignment::Start` in the horizontal branch.
- **Dead code** — `Layout::GetChildren` / `SetBackgroundColor` (+ member +
  render branch), `Label::GetVisualHeight`, `ActionMap::ClearBindings`,
  `ResourceManager::ForEach() const`, `GameplayState::nextTetrominoLabel`, two
  stray `SettingsState` constants.
- Minor: `Application` ctor initialiser list follows declaration order;
  `Board::Contains` / `IntersectsLockedCells` are private (`CanPlace` is the
  only caller).

`UI::MenuList` and `SettingsRowList` remain two selection models — merging them
is left to the Phase 2 main-menu overhaul, which rewrites navigation anyway.

Also landed here, ahead of when it's used: **`input/gamepad/GamepadHaptics`**,
ported whole from ULA (self-contained, no SFML). Xbox rumble via XInput,
DualSense rumble + lightbar + adaptive triggers via the vendored
`libs/DualSenseWindows` (MIT, raw HID, built as source at `/W3`). Wired into
`Application` (owned, ticked) and `GamepadManager::SetHaptics` (a faint tick on
every gamepad menu move). The gameplay pulses, the by-state lightbar, the
trigger effects on rotate, and the vibration settings are v1.1.0.

### v1.0.8 — Localization pipe

Every on-screen string moved from its call site into a flat catalog
(`assets/data/localization/en.txt`, `section.key = value`, `#` comments, `\n`,
UTF-8). `LocalizationManager::GetText` / `FormatText` (with `{token}`
placeholders); `localization/TextKeys.h` holds every key as an
`inline constexpr string_view` grouped by screen. `Context` carries a
`LocalizationManager&`; all six states and the HUD pull their text from it. A
missing key renders as `<key>` rather than crashing. A `Language` enum,
per-language fonts and a live-switch revision counter are left for the v1.4.0
language work. English only; no JSON dependency.

### v1.0.7 — Visual pass & first tests

Foundations for the look, and a safety net under the rules. No gameplay changes.

- **`rendering/NeonGlow`** — real additive bloom for the active piece and the
  selected menu button: source rendered to an off-screen buffer, silhouette
  grown by a square dilation (`neon_dilate.frag`) so the edge-glow is even on
  every side and corner, softened by a separable Gaussian (`neon_blur.frag`),
  composited back tinted and pulsing. Replaces the fake 1.18×-scale glow and the
  flat `glow.frag` menu highlight (both removed). `crt.frag` now uses its `time`
  uniform, silencing the `Uniform "time" not found` launch warning.
- **`ui/NineSliceFrame`** in `Button` / `Panel` — corners stay unscaled, edges
  and centre stretch. *Note:* the current `panel_background` / `button_background`
  art isn't symmetric, so the payoff is small until those are replaced (see
  Phase 2 visual overhaul).
- **`ui/TextLayout`** — `FitWidth` scales text down to a max width instead of
  changing character size (no per-string atlas rebuild); `CentreOrigin`.
  `Label::SetMaxWidth`; the gameplay HUD caps its labels so the controls block
  no longer overruns its panel.
- **`/W4` → 0 + warnings-as-errors.** C4244 fixed, C4100 fixed, C4458 disabled
  project-wide (the deliberate ctor/param-name idiom).
- **First unit tests** — a `TesseraTests` project (own `.vcxproj`, in the
  solution, out of the game build) on doctest: 25 cases over `Board`,
  `Tetromino`, `TetrominoBag`, `GameplaySession`.

`ScreenFade` and `GlowingCursor` were dropped — cursor design and menu
transitions are a v1.1 discussion.

### v1.0.6 — GameState split

Broke the ~950-line `GameState` god-class into model / state / renderer /
effects. Behaviour unchanged — relocation only.

- **`src/game/` → `src/gameplay/`** (matches ULA's own `game` → `gameplay`
  rename, done for the same "what lives where?" reason).
- **`gameplay/GameplaySession`** — the pure rules and state of one playthrough:
  board, bag, active + next piece, gravity, row-clear delay, scoring, levelling.
  No SFML, no `Context`. The host pushes input intents, calls `Update(dt)`, then
  drains `ConsumeEvents()` (landed / rows detected / rows cleared / levelled up /
  game over). Named for the concept, not the game, so a future rename of Tessera
  touches nothing here. (ULA calls the same thing `GameplaySession` too.)
- **`states/GameplayState`** (was `GameState`) — owns the session, the input
  layer, the HUD, and the renderers; turns session events into sound, HUD text
  and screen effects.
- **`rendering/BoardRenderer`** — board gradient, walls, locked cells, ghost,
  active piece (glow + normal), next-piece preview. Reads the session only.
- **`rendering/EffectsController`** — the timer state machine behind screen
  shake, the landing flash and the row-clear flash / sweep.
- Restored a lost UTF-8 BOM that had turned the controls-panel arrows to mojibake.

### v1.0.5 — Input abstraction, gamepad & DAS/ARR

- **`input/InputBinding` + `ActionMap<Action>` + `InputHandler<Action>`**
  (ported from ULA): a physical input (`sf::Keyboard::Scancode` or mouse button)
  + a trigger (`OnPress` / `OnRelease` / `WhileHeld`), a per-action bindings
  table, and a callback dispatcher. Gamepad is **not** in the binding variant
  (a d-pad is a POV axis, button indices are vendor-specific) — same reason ULA
  keeps `GamepadManager` separate.
- **`input/GamepadManager`** (ported, slimmed): Xbox / PlayStation by USB
  vendor id, stick dead zones, menu `NavigationAction`, pause, and polled
  gameplay queries. The twin-stick aim code is dropped.
- **`input/DirectionalRepeater`** (new): DAS/ARR for left/right — one step on
  press, a pause, then auto-repeat. The main "feel" fix; ULA has no equivalent.
- **`input/MenuInput::Resolve`**: one keyboard-or-gamepad event → one
  `MenuInput::Action`. MainMenu / Pause / GameOver / Settings / Statistics now
  handle that enum instead of raw scancodes, so the gamepad drives every menu
  for free.
- **Mouse in menus**: `MenuList::PointerPressed`; the states translate the
  cursor to view space and forward hover / left click. GameOver gains a Back to
  leave without saving. Cursor visible again.
- `GameState` drives all gameplay input through the abstraction; `GameSettings`
  gets a `ControlSettings` (default keyboard bindings, not persisted — the
  rebinding UI + save/load land with the Options screen in v1.4.0).

### v1.0.4 — SFML DLL post-build copy & persistence

- Post-build step copies the config's four `sfml-*-3.dll` from `libs/SFML/bin/`
  next to the exe; `libs/SFML/` stays git-ignored.
- `utils/AppDataPath` (ported): saves → `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Alone Bull Company\
  Tessera\`. `utils/SafeFileWrite` (ported): atomic `.tmp` → `.bak` swap;
  `PreserveCorruptFile` keeps an unreadable file as `.corrupt`.
- `SettingsManager` / `HighScoreManager` write through `SafeFileWrite` and
  version each file; a wrong-version or unparseable file → `.corrupt` + defaults.
- Top-level `data/` gone; `Assets.h` `Data::Paths` → `SaveFile::`.

### v1.0.1 — Rename to Tessera, build hygiene & pause-menu crash fix

- Adopted the branch / PR / tag / release workflow; added `BACKLOG.md`,
  `.editorconfig`, `docs/`.
- Renamed `Tetris` → `Tessera` (GitHub repo, `.slnx` / `.vcxproj`, window title,
  main-menu title, README, `RootNamespace`).
- Dropped the broken Win32/x86 configurations; single x64 target on C++23.
- Warning level raised to `/W4`; fixed the discarded `[[nodiscard]]`
  render-texture results. (~40 pre-existing `/W4` warnings remain, cleared in
  v1.0.6.)
- `static_assert` the vendored SFML is exactly 3.1.0.
- Stopped tracking runtime player data; `data/.gitkeep` keeps the directory.
- Clamp the per-frame delta time (`Game::MaxFrameTime`).
- Replaced the `dynamic_cast<PauseState*>` render check with a `StateId` enum.
- Stop locking the tetromino twice on a hard drop.
- Screen-shake offset computed in `Update`, applied in `Render`; no
  divide-by-zero.
- Bounds-checked `Board::IntersectsLockedCells`.
- `StatisticsState` shares the context `HighScoreManager`.
- **Fixed the pause-menu crash (present since v1.0):** Pause > "Restart" /
  "Main Menu" destroyed the `PauseState` mid-method. `StateMachine` now queues
  every push / pop / clear / change and applies them only in
  `ApplyPendingChanges()`.

### v1.0.3 — Application rename, centralised events & MenuList

- `Game` → `Application`, moved to `src/app/`.
- Centralised window events: `Application::HandleInput()` /
  `ApplyWindowLifecycleEvent()`; `State::ProcessEvents(window)` →
  `State::HandleEvent(const sf::Event&)`.
- `State` base holds a `StateMachine&` + protected `RequestPush/Pop/Clear/
  Change`; copy/move deleted.
- `UI::Button::SetEnabled(bool)` + `disabledStyle` — removes GameOverState's
  Save-button hack.
- `UI::MenuList` — keyboard selection controller (wrap, skip disabled,
  `onSelectionChanged` / `onActivate`, `SelectAt()` stubbed). MainMenu / Pause /
  GameOver de-duplicated; move sound only fires on a real selection change.
- Mouse support cut (new feature) → v1.0.5 with the gamepad work.

### v1.0.2 — Board scan, row-clear phase & settings fixes

- Bounds-safety pass across `Board`; guard `LockTetromino` before indexing.
- Split `ClearFullRows` into `FindFullRows()` + `ClearRows(rows)` so a clear
  runs one scan, not two that could disagree.
- Row-clear is an explicit `Phase` (`Falling` / `ClearingRows`); the just-locked
  piece and its ghost stop drawing over the board during the clear animation.
- Next-piece preview centred on the piece's own bounding box.
- `AudioPlayer` caps concurrent voices at 32.
- `settings.txt` parsed into a scratch copy; defaults kept + file rewritten if
  any field is missing or out of range.
- FPS-limit slider reaches "Unlimited" at 0, steps by 10; not applied over vsync.

## Planned

**Roadmap reset — 2026-09-09.** The campaign / multi-mode / local-PvP / AI
roadmap is dropped. Tessera is being wound down as a small, cleanly-built game:
**one endless mode that escalates over time**, with the menu system as its
showpiece — finished, polished, then done. No campaign, no level select, no
save-progress system, no achievements, no PvP, no AI. Four short versions, each
verified before the next, easy work before hard.

Why: the core game holds no interest for the author (a shooter and a platformer
did) and forcing months of Tetris content is the wrong trade. The menu framework
was always meant as a reusable cross-project UI library — it carries forward
regardless.

### v1.4.0 — Menu cleanup & flow

No gameplay-rules changes. Make the front-end feel finished and consistent.

- **Remove the Achievements ring entry** — no achievements are coming.
- **Remove mode select entirely.** "Start Game" becomes **"Play"** and drops
  straight into gameplay. Delete `states/ModeSelectScreen`, its Campaign /
  Other Modes columns, and their `TextKey::ModeSelect` keys. One endless mode is
  the whole game; Marathon stays the working baseline.
- **Rebuild Records.** The legacy `states/StatisticsState` (own old background,
  reached through `ScreenHost::ExitTo`) becomes a `RecordsScreen : MenuScreen`
  on the shared `ScreenHost`, folded into the menu shell with the header morph
  like Options and Credits. Look + structure only — records are still set (the
  name entry in `GameOverState` stays) and kept; no delete. Its own in-screen
  animation is a separate design pass (the author will describe it).
- **Animate the entry into gameplay.** The menu already flies the title up and
  disintegrates the ring on exit; build the tail and a gameplay entrance so the
  menu → board cut is animated like every other transition in the game.
- **Redesign `ui/ConfirmDialog`** (the yes / no warning dialog) — its current
  look is minimal and off-style.
- **Rewrite the Credits text** (the author will supply it).
- **Cleanup pass** — strip the dead campaign / mode / PvP scaffolding from code,
  docs and memory; `docs/CAMPAIGN_AND_MODES.md` and `docs/ULA_PORT_ANALYSIS.md`
  are removed (both fully superseded).

### v1.5.0 — Gameplay presentation & Game Over

- **In-game visual pass.** Background to the retro-pixel + CRT look —
  game-driven parallax drift over a static themed backdrop, plus a depth-layered
  particle layer. Restyled HUD (next queue, score / level / lines). Remove the
  left-hand controls text block.
- **Begin the Game Over rework** — one screen, two states (new record / no new
  record), rebuilt to the menu-shell standard. It is the last screen still on
  the legacy `MenuScreenState`.

### v1.6.0 — Gameplay depth & escalation

The version that finishes the gameplay. Likely splits in two as it is built
(rules first, then escalation content).

- **Modern rules, so it feels right to play:** SRS rotation + wall kicks +
  T-spin (3-corner rule), lock delay + move reset, hold piece, 5-deep next
  queue, 7-bag confirmed, buffer rows above the field + block-out / lock-out,
  guideline-style scoring (Single / Double / Triple / Tetris multipliers, combo,
  back-to-back, Perfect Clear), on-board callouts.
- **Gameplay-settings toggles** that now have a mechanic behind them: ghost
  piece, hold, next-queue length, 7-bag vs random. Extend `GameplayCategoryPanel`
  (rows + `GameSettings` fields, bump FormatVersion). Hold needs a new
  rebindable key — `ControlSettings` field, a Keyboard row, a Gamepad
  assignment. If Gameplay grows past ~6 rows, split it into sub-sections.
- **Gamepad vibration on gameplay actions** — land / hard-drop / wall contact /
  row-clear / tetris / level-up / top-out / T-spin, gated by the existing
  Vibration toggle. `input/gamepad/GamepadHaptics` is already in the tree and
  wired; only the gameplay firing is missing.
- **Escalation design** — how the single endless mode gets harder over time:
  which bonuses, obstacles and rule modifiers appear at which point, and the
  pacing of pressure vs breather stretches. (This absorbs the old campaign
  "modifier pool" idea as escalation tiers rather than discrete levels.)

### v1.7.0 — Localization & final refactor

The final version. After it the game is done — there is no v2.0.

- **Localization** — the multi-language load + first-run picker + live switch
  for the settled five (English, Spanish, German, Russian, Ukrainian). The UI
  scaffold shipped in v1.2.0; port `LocalizationRevision` + a text-warmup pass
  from ULA. Deferred to here because retranslating churning strings mid-build is
  wasteful.
- **Project-wide refactor and polish** — tighten the feel, clean the code, pull
  back any improvements from ULA's shared helpers (`NineSliceFrame`,
  `TextLayout`, `NeonGlow`, `GamepadHaptics`), a final dead-code sweep.
- **Release** — README as a finished piece, screenshots / GIFs, itch.io page,
  `Tessera-v1.7.0-win64.zip`, GitHub Release as the last one.

### Visual overhaul (spans v1.5.0–v1.7.0)

The whole game look is still to be raised. `panel_background` /
`button_background` / `game_background` etc. want art built to be
nine-sliceable — the current frames aren't symmetric, so `NineSliceFrame` can't
do much with them yet. The author sources art as each version needs it.

---

## Deferred ideas

- Colorblind palettes and adjustable grid opacity — candidates for the v1.7.0
  polish pass.
- Sprint (40 lines) / Ultra (2 minutes) as extra record modes — cheap to add on
  top of the v1.6.0 escalation work if wanted; not currently planned.
